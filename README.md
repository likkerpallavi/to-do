## Introduction to the To-Do List Application
Overview: The To-Do List application is a practical tool designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. It enables users to keep track of their activities, set deadlines, and receive reminders, ensuring they stay on top of their responsibilities.
**
Key Features:**

## Task Management:

Creation and Organization: Users can create tasks with relevant details such as titles, descriptions, and due dates. Tasks are stored locally, allowing users to manage their to-dos without relying on internet connectivity.
Completion Tracking: Tasks can be marked as completed once they are finished, which helps users keep a record of their progress and maintain a clear overview of what’s done and what’s pending.
## Data Storage with SQLite:

Local Storage: The application utilizes SQLite, a lightweight and efficient database engine, to store task data locally on the user's device. This includes information about task titles, descriptions, due dates, and completion status.
Data Integrity: By using SQLite, the app ensures that task data is persistently stored and remains accessible even if the application is closed or the device is restarted.
Scheduling Notifications:

## Task Reminders: Users can set reminders for tasks, which are scheduled to trigger notifications at specified times. This feature helps users remember important deadlines and stay organized.
Customizable Alerts: Notifications can be tailored to suit individual preferences, ensuring that users are alerted at the most convenient times to manage their tasks effectively.
User Experience: The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on providing a seamless experience for task management. Users can easily navigate through their tasks, receive timely reminders, and access their data locally without needing an internet connection.

## Benefits:

Enhanced Productivity: By organizing tasks and setting reminders, users can improve their productivity and manage their time more effectively.
Reliable Data Storage: SQLite provides a reliable and secure method for storing task data locally, ensuring data persistence and accessibility.
Timely Notifications: Scheduled notifications help users stay on track with their deadlines and avoid missing important tasks.
